## Overview

### The Challenge
The task was to create a **responsive recipe page** that includes:
- A recipe introduction with a description and preparation time.
- Lists for ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
- Nutritional information presented clearly and concisely.

The design needed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes while ensuring accessibility and a clean, modern layout.

## My Process

### Built With
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for improved readability and accessibility.
- **CSS**:
  - Custom properties for consistent theming and maintainability.
  - Flexbox for flexible and responsive layouts.
  - Media queries to ensure responsiveness across devices.
- **Accessibility Features**:
  - ARIA labels and focus-visible styles for better keyboard navigation.
  - Skip link for improved user experience.

### What I Learned
This project helped reinforce:
1. **CSS Variables**: Leveraging variables for colors, spacing, and font sizes made styling consistent and manageable.
2. **Responsive Design**:
   - The mobile-first approach ensured a clean layout that adapts well to different devices.
   - Media queries were used effectively to adjust the layout for tablets and desktops.
3. **Accessibility**:
   - Added a skip link and focus-visible styles to enhance navigation for all users.
   - Used ARIA attributes and semantic HTML to improve screen reader support.

### Continued Development
For future projects, I plan to focus on:
- **Interactivity**: Adding JavaScript for features like dynamically changing content or calculating custom nutritional values.
- **Grid Layout**: Experimenting with CSS Grid for more complex and flexible layouts.
- **Advanced Accessibility Testing**: Using tools like Lighthouse or NVDA to refine accessibility further.
